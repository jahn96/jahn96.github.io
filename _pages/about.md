Hi! I am a Master's Computer Science student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I am grateful to be advised by [Dr. Foaad Khosmood](http://foaad.net/). My research interests reside in Natural Language Processing. Currently, I am interested in 1) exploring implicit structure, style, or relations in different forms of a natural language, 2) developing architectures and algorithms for natural language generation, 3) generating fluent, human-like summarization that contains the key points as well as the correct factual information.

I also completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.
